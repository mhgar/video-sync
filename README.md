# What is this?

A web app for syncing movies over the internet using socket.io. It is meant to sync local video files by means of pausing, playing and seeking. Rather than transcode and stream the video to parties involved, it relies on clients to download the video first. While this is more involved than a streaming solution, it allows the best possible video quality.
